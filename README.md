# Project Title: Automation Testing for Satu.Tempo.co Web Application

Welcome to the Automation Testing project for the staging environment of the Satu.Tempo.co web application. This repository aims to provide a robust suite of automated tests designed to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application. The project leverages powerful tools and frameworks to achieve comprehensive testing coverage.

## Technologies Used:
- **Selenium**: A widely used framework for automating web applications for testing purposes. It supports various browsers and allows for the execution of complex user interactions.
- **Java**: The primary programming language utilised in this project, known for its portability and extensive ecosystem.
- **Cucumber**: A tool that supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), allowing you to write test cases in a human-readable format. It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Gherkin**: The language used to write feature files for Cucumber, enabling clear and concise test case specifications.

## Prerequisites:
To successfully run the automation tests in this project, you will need to install the following software on your local machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed. You can download it from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK.
2. **Apache Maven**: A build automation tool primarily for Java projects. Maven simplifies the build process and manages dependencies. Download it from the official Maven website and follow the installation instructions.
3. **WebDriver**: Depending on the browser you wish to automate (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), download the corresponding WebDriver and ensure it is in your system's PATH. For example, for Chrome, you will need ChromeDriver.

## Running the Tests:
Once you have set up the required software, you can execute the test suite by navigating to the root directory of the project in your terminal and running the following command:
```bash
mvn clean test
```
This command will clean the previous builds and run the complete test suite. 

## Note on Test Cases:
In the test suite, you will notice that some test cases are commented out with a `#` symbol. Before executing the tests, ensure to uncomment these test cases as needed to include them in your test run. This allows you to control which tests to execute based on your current testing focus.
